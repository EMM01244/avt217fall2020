 <div class="sectionbreak">
   <p>     You may also make an appointment to see the gallery or an individual artist on weekdays.
     New artists are juried into the gallery by member artists. Since the gallery accommodates a small number of local artists, a waiting list is kept for studio space. Artists often work at the gallery in their studio space. Visitors to the gallery may watch artists at work and talk to them about their process.  Each month there is a rotating show in the main gallery room displaying one or more of the member artists’ work.</p>
