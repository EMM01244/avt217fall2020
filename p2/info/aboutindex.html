    <h2>The Velvet Velvet Studio Art Gallery in Fairfax Co., Northern Virginia</h2>
    <p>The Velvet Velvet Art Gallery and Studios is a privately-owned cooperative gallery and studio in the historical part of Reston known as Lake Anne.  The gallery is open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays from 12 to 5 PM.</p>
    <p> You may also make an appointment to see the gallery or an individual artist on weekdays.</p>
    <p>New artists are juried into the gallery by member artists. Since the gallery accommodates a small number of local artists, a waiting list is kept for studio space. Artists often work at the gallery in their studio space. Visitors to the gallery may watch artists at work and talk to them about their process.  Each month there is a rotating show in the main gallery room displaying one or more of the member artists’ work.
       All artwork displayed is marked for sale by the individual artist.  Artwork is available in a variety of disciplines.  These may include (but are not limited to): paintings (watercolor, oil, and acrylic), mixed media, collage, photography, jewelry, printmaking, and pastels.  Many artists offer cards and prints.
       We look forward to your visit and your attendance at our shows!</p>

    <h2>COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT The Velvet Velvet</h2>

    <p>For more than 85 years, The Velvet Velvet has served as a place to find connections and inspiration while being the cultural heart of our region. To continue that work, consider making a contribution that will support virtually every area of museum activity and is vital to our mission of connecting art to life. By making a donation to the SAM Fund, you will personally help us continue to develop new exhibitions focused on art that excites and educates our audiences, carry on our commitment to creating racial equity and structural change through the increase of acquisition and presentation of works by Black artists, Indigenous artists and artists of color, as well as conserve and preserve over 25,000 objects in our global collection. With your help SAM will remain a vibrant center for the arts in our region for many years to come.</p>

    <p>The Velvet Velvet Forward is a $150 million campaign which will advance the museum in three key areas: renovating and enhancing the Seattle Asian Art Museum, our original home in Volunteer Park; investing in strategic initiatives to support bold new projects which will strengthen our position as an international leader in the arts; and growing our endowment to ensure we are a thriving and dynamic institution, now and forever.</p>
