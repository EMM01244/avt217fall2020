    <h4>About Exhibits Shop</h4>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>The Velvet Velvet Art Gallery and Studios is a privately-owned cooperative gallery and studio in the historical part of Reston known as Lake Anne.</p>
    <p> You may also make an appointment to see the gallery or an individual artist on weekdays.</p>
    <p>New artists are juried into the gallery by member artists. Since the gallery accommodates a small number of local artists, a waiting list is kept for studio space. Artists often work at the gallery in their studio space. Visitors to the gallery may watch artists at work and talk to them about their process.  Each month there is a rotating show in the main gallery room displaying one or more of the member artistsâ€™ work.
       All artwork displayed is marked for sale by the individual artist.  Artwork is available in a variety of disciplines.  These may include (but are not limited to): paintings (watercolor, oil, and acrylic), mixed media, collage, photography, jewelry, printmaking, and pastels.  Many artists offer cards and prints.
       We look forward to your visit and your attendance at our shows!</p>
